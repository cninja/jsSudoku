##Sudoku Solver In Javascript
Everyone makes these right?

##Why I did it
Came accross a link to an article titled [How not to solve a Sodoku](http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/).
It compares two different programmers in their efforts to product a Sodoku solver. Before I started reading
implementations from either programmer, I decided to implement my own to see how I compared to the two
that are discussed.

##Conclusions
TBD on reading the article.
